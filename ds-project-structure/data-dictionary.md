The primary objective of a data dictionary is to enable quick comprehension of a dataset's analytical potential. It should allow any team member to rapidly assess what insights can be extracted and what limitations exist within the data structure.
## Core Information
- Column description: Clear explanation of what the data represents and its purpose
- Unique value count: Number of distinct values (when this information provides meaningful context)

## Best Practices
- Prioritize clarity and conciseness over comprehensive detail
- Focus on information that directly impacts analytical decision-making
- Structure entries to facilitate quick reference during exploratory data analysis
