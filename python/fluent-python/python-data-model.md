Python Data Model
- the API that we use to make our own objects play well with the most idiomatic language features
- a description of Python as a framework
- formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, context managers, etc.

## Classes
- when building new classes, the Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations, often triggered by special syntax
	- special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores
	- `obj[key]` is supported by the `__get_item__` special method so in order to evaluate `my_collection[key]`, the interpreter calls `my_collection.__get_item__(key)`
- special methods are implemented when we want our objects to support and interact with fundamental language constructs such as:
	- collections
	- attribute access
	- iteration (including asynchronous iteration using `async for`)
	- operator overloading
	- function and method invocation
	- string representation and formatting
	- asynchronous programming using `await`
	- object creation and destruction
	- managed contexts using the `with` or `async with` statements
- special methods / magic methods: allow you to define how objects of a class interact with fundamental language features

## Language Constructs
1. Collections
	- data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, or other objects that can store multiple items and support operations like checking memberships, getting length, or indexing
	- how special methods help:
		- `__len__(self)`: defines the behavior of `len(obj)` to return the size of the object
		- `__getitem__(self, key)`: allows indexing, like `obj[key]`
		- `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: enables setting values with `obj[key] = value`
		- `__contains__(self, item)`: supports `item in obj` checks
2. Attribute Access
	- refers to accessing, setting, or deleting an object's attributes using dot notation (e.g., `obj.name`) or dynamic attribute handling
	- how to control attribute acces:
	     - `__getattr__(self, name)`: called when an attribute is not found (e.g., `obj.unknown`).
	     - `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: controls setting attributes (e.g., `obj.name = value`).
	     - `__delattr__(self, name)`: handles deleting attributes (e.g., `del obj.name`).

### 3. **Iteration (Including Asynchronous Iteration Using `async for`)**
   - **What it is**: Iteration allows looping over an object, like `for item in obj`. Asynchronous iteration is similar but used in async contexts with `async for`.
   - **How special methods help**:
     - For regular iteration:
       - `__iter__(self)`: Returns an iterator object.
       - `__next__(self)`: Defines the next item in the iteration (used by the iterator).
     - For asynchronous iteration:
       - `__aiter__(self)`: Returns an async iterator.
       - `__anext__(self)`: Asynchronously returns the next item.
   - **Example**: Implementing `__iter__` and `__next__` lets you loop over your object like a list. `__aiter__` and `__anext__` enable `async for` in async code, like streaming data.

### 4. **Operator Overloading**
   - **What it is**: This lets you define how operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, `==`, etc., work with your objects.
   - **How special methods help**: You define methods like:
     - `__add__(self, other)`: Defines `obj + other`.
     - `__eq__(self, other)`: Defines `obj == other`.
     - `__lt__(self, other)`: Defines `obj < other`.
   - **Example**: If you create a `Vector` class, `__add__` could let you add two vectors with `v1 + v2`.

### 5. **Function and Method Invocation**
   - **What it is**: This refers to making an object callable, like a function, using parentheses (e.g., `obj()`).
   - **How special methods help**:
     - `__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Makes an instance callable like a function.
   - **Example**: If you implement `__call__` in a class, you can use an instance like `my_obj()` to execute custom logic, as if it were a function.

### 6. **String Representation and Formatting**
   - **What it is**: This controls how your object is represented as a string, such as when printed or formatted (e.g., `str(obj)`, `repr(obj)`, or `f"{obj}"`).
   - **How special methods help**:
     - `__str__(self)`: Defines the informal, human-readable string for `str(obj)` or `print(obj)`.
     - `__repr__(self)`: Defines the formal string for debugging, used by `repr(obj)`.
     - `__format__(self, format_spec)`: Controls custom formatting in f-strings or `format()`.
   - **Example**: For a `Point` class, `__str__` might return `"Point(3, 4)"` for `print(point)`, while `__repr__` might return a string that could recreate the object.

### 7. **Asynchronous Programming Using `await`**
   - **What it is**: This allows objects to be used in asynchronous code with the `await` keyword, typically for tasks like awaiting async operations.
   - **How special methods help**:
     - `__await__(self)`: Makes an object awaitable, defining what happens when `await obj` is used.
   - **Example**: You could create an object that, when awaited, performs an async operation like fetching data from a server.

### 8. **Object Creation and Destruction**
   - **What it is**: This involves defining how objects are created (initialized) and cleaned up when no longer needed.
   - **How special methods help**:
     - `__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)`: Controls object creation (called before `__init__`).
     - `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Initializes an object after creation.
     - `__del__(self)`: Defines cleanup actions when an object is garbage-collected.
   - **Example**: `__init__` sets up an object’s initial state (e.g., `self.x = x`), while `__del__` might close a file or release resources when the object is destroyed.

### 9. **Managed Contexts Using the `with` or `async with` Statements**
   - **What it is**: The `with` statement manages resources (like files) that need setup and cleanup. `async with` does the same for asynchronous contexts.
   - **How special methods help**:
     - For `with`:
       - `__enter__(self)`: Defines what happens when entering a `with` block.
       - `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Defines cleanup when exiting the block.
     - For `async with`:
       - `__aenter__(self)`: Defines async setup for entering an `async with` block.
       - `__aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Defines async cleanup.
   - **Example**: Implementing `__enter__` and `__exit__` lets your object manage a resource (e.g., opening/closing a file) in a `with` statement. `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` do the same for async contexts, like managing async database connections.

### Summary
Special methods let you customize how your objects interact with Python’s core features. By implementing these methods, your objects can mimic built-in types (like lists or dictionaries), support operators, be callable, work in async code, or manage resources safely. Each method ties directly to a specific language construct, giving you fine-grained control over your object’s behavior.
