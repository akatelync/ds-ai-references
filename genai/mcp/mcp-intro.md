> MCP is a standard like HTTP or USB-C, and is a protocol for connecting AI applications to external tools and data sources. Therefore, using standard terminology is crucial to making the MCP work effectively.

When documenting our applications and communicating with the community, we should use the following terminology.
## M x N Integration Problem
- the challenge of connecting M different AI applications to N different external tools or data sources without a standardized approach

## Components
1. Host - user-facing AI application that end-users interact with directly
2. Client - component within the host application that manages communication with a specific MCP Server
3. Server - external program or service that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) via the MCP protocol
